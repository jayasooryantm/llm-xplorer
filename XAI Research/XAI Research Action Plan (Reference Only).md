### Roadmap specifically tailored to Large Language Models (LLMs) with a 6-month action plan.

**Roadmap: Becoming an LLM Researcher**

**Phase 1: Knowledge Deep Dive (Months 1-3)**

- **Transformer Architecture Mastery:** Focus on the core concepts behind transformers (attention mechanisms, encoder-decoder structures, etc.). Understand how they revolutionised LLMs.
    - Resources:
        - "Attention Is All You Need" paper ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762))
        - The Illustrated Transformer (blog): [http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)
- **LLM Libraries & Frameworks:** Gain expertise in libraries like Hugging Face Transformers and tools specifically geared towards LLMs. Experiment with pre-trained models and fine-tuning.
- **Key LLM Research:** Dive into seminal papers that transformed the field (GPT series, LaMDA, etc.). Analyse their techniques, strengths, and limitations.

**Phase 2: Project-Driven Learning (Months 3-6)**

- **Project 1: LLM Refinement:**
    - Choose a smaller-scale pre-trained LLM.
    - Experiment with fine-tuning it on a specialised dataset for a unique task (e.g., text summarisation for a specific domain, creative text generation, etc. ).
    - Goal: Understand the practicalities of working with LLMs and their adaptability.
- **Project 2: Pushing Boundaries (Choose one):**
    - **Efficiency:** Explore techniques for compressing LLMs or making them run on less powerful hardware.
    - **Bias Mitigation:** Research and implement strategies to reduce bias and harmful outputs in LLMs.
    - **Novel Application:** Find a niche problem where an LLM-based solution could excel. Design and prototype it.
- **Document & Share:** Meticulously document your projects on GitHub. Start a technical blog to break down your findings and the challenges you overcame.

**Alongside Projects:**

- **Network Like Crazy:** Attend relevant online conferences, meetups, and find LLM-focused communities. Connect with people working in the field.
- **Stay Ahead of the Curve:** Actively follow new LLM research, trends in model scaling, and ethical considerations.

**6-Month Check-In: What You'll Have**

- Solid understanding of transformer-based LLMs.
- Portfolio of projects demonstrating your ability to apply and potentially improve LLMs
- Technical blog articulating your learnings.
- A growing network within the LLM research community.

**Remember:**

- **Startups:** Don't just fixate on DeepMind. Look for innovative startups doing cutting-edge LLM work; they may be more receptive.
- **Flexibility:** The AI field evolves rapidly. Adapt your roadmap if exciting new directions emerge.
