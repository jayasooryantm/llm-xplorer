Getting started with open-source projects in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a great way to build your skills and contribute to the community. Here are some well-known projects and repositories you can explore:

### 1. **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)**
LIME is a popular tool for explaining the predictions of machine learning models. It provides interpretable explanations by approximating the model locally with an interpretable model.

- **GitHub Repository**: [LIME](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime)
- **Getting Started**: You can start by going through the examples and documentation in the repository to understand how LIME works.

### 2. **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**
SHAP leverages game theory to explain the output of any machine learning model. It assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction.

- **GitHub Repository**: [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap)
- **Getting Started**: The repository includes detailed tutorials and example notebooks that can help you get started with SHAP.

### 3. **ELI5**
ELI5 is a library for debugging machine learning classifiers and explaining their predictions. It supports many models and libraries, such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, and more.

- **GitHub Repository**: [ELI5](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/eli5)
- **Getting Started**: The repository contains documentation and examples to help you understand how to use ELI5.

### 4. **InterpretML**
InterpretML is an open-source package from Microsoft that provides tools for training interpretable models and explaining blackbox systems.
