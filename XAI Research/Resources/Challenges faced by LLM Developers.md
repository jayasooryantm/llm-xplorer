**1. Bias and Fairness:** LLMs trained on massive datasets often inherit and amplify biases present in that data. This can lead to discriminatory outputs, unfair treatment of certain demographics, and perpetuation of stereotypes. Your research could explore how to go beyond attention mechanisms to identify and mitigate bias in LLM outputs.

**2. Hallucinations and Factuality:** LLMs are adept at generating creative text formats, but they can struggle with factual accuracy and sometimes invent information (hallucinate). XAI techniques that look beyond attention could help developers understand how LLMs arrive at their outputs and identify when they're making things up.

**3. Interpretability and Explainability:** The inner workings of complex LLMs are often opaque, making it difficult to understand how they arrive at their outputs. This lack of interpretability hinders debugging, improving accuracy, and building trust with users. Your research could explore ways to use attention and other mechanisms to provide a clearer picture of LLM decision-making.

**4. Efficiency and Scalability:** Training and running LLMs can be computationally expensive. New techniques are needed to make LLMs more efficient and scalable for real-world applications. Here, research that goes beyond attention might uncover ways to optimize the training process or develop more lightweight LLM architectures.

**5. Safety and Security:** As LLMs become more powerful, concerns arise about their potential misuse for malicious purposes like generating propaganda or spreading misinformation. XAI techniques could help developers identify and mitigate potential safety risks associated with LLMs.
