Here's a potential outline for how to structure it and the kind of research questions you might explore:

**Thesis Title:** Beyond Attention: Creating Faithful and Actionable Explanations for Large Language Model Decision-Making

**Problem Statement:**

- Current LLM interpretability techniques often oversimplify by focusing on attention mechanisms alone. This can lead to convincing but misleading explanations that don't reflect the model's true internal logic.
- To build trust and to leverage LLMs for critical tasks, we need explanations that are truly faithful to how an LLM arrived at an output.
- Furthermore, explanations shouldn't be a one-way street; they should empower users to interact with the LLM to correct faulty reasoning and improve its performance over time.

**Research Goals:**

1. **Develop methods for generating multi-faceted LLM explanations:** Combine attention visualisation with techniques like:
    - Input perturbation and sensitivity analysis.
    - Probing intermediate layers of the LLM for their learned representations.
    - Forcing the LLM to produce counterfactual examples to reveal what it has implicitly learned.
2. **Design interactive interfaces and feedback mechanisms:** Allow domain experts to interrogate explanations, identify errors, and provide corrective annotations. Examples of interaction:
    - Highlighting sections of the input that were deemed unimportant by the explanation but the expert believes are crucial.
    - Providing alternative explanations that better fit the expert's domain knowledge.
3. **Develop learning paradigms for the LLM to incorporate this feedback:** Investigate methods to retrain or fine-tune the LLM based on user-provided corrections to its explanations. Potentially, this involves meta-learning approaches, so the model improves its ability to learn from explanations over time.

**Evaluation**

- **Faithfulness:** Conduct rigorous experiments with human experts assessing if the multi-faceted explanations reflect the ground-truth of the task on which the LLM was trained. Develop quantitative metrics alongside expert judgment.
- **Iterative Improvement:** Demonstrate that the LLM's performance on a quantitative task benchmark consistently improves as a result of the expert-in-the-loop feedback on explanations.
- **Qualitative Insights:** Through expert interviews and case studies, demonstrate that the interactive explanations help them build trust in the LLM, or alternatively, highlight areas where the model's reasoning remains fundamentally flawed.

**Potential Applications**

- **High-stakes domains:** Medicine, law, and finance all need trustworthy and correctable AI systems.
- **Scientific discovery:** Interactive explanations for scientific LLMs could help researchers refine hypotheses and discover new knowledge.
- **LLM development and debugging:** Even AI researchers could benefit from tools that lay bare a model's decision-making, helping them catch unintended behaviours or biases early in the development process.

**Challenges**

- **Complexity of integrating multiple explanation techniques.**
- **Designing interfaces intuitive for non-AI experts.**
- The "true reasoning" of an LLM might itself be opaque, making faithfulness a somewhat fuzzy goal.
